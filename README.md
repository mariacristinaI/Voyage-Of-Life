# Voyage-Of-Life
This is a tribute page made for a series of four paintings by Thomas Cole.
Each painting is an allegory of a stage in a human's life. These paintings were made in the late 18th century and were part of the Romanticism movement.
I decided as a contrast to display at the bottom of the page, two paintings of the Abstract expressionism movement, which appeared a century later. One of them is a painting made by me entirely with CSS in a Rothko Art Style. Besides the voyage of life, there is also a voyage of art.

This page was built using HTML5 and vanilla CSS3 mixed with Bootstrap as a CSS Framework.
